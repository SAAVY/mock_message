<h3>Bloomberg Internship Experience</h3>
<div id="bb-introduction">
<p>
  I'm a fourth year software engineering student at the University of Waterloo. During Fall 2015, I had the opportunity to complete a 4 month internship at Bloomberg LP, New York as a Software Developer. I'm writing this to share my experience about the internship.
</p>

<br />
<h4>HOUSING</h4>
<div id="bb-housing">
  <p>
    Bloomberg covered airfare from Toronto to New York City, as well as the taxi service from LaGuardia to the company-provided housing. Bloomberg hired 14 software interns from University of Waterloo, and all of us took the company provided housing instead of the lump sum which was offered if we wanted to find our own housing.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rooms were in a dormitory style apartment in the Upper East Side. We had individual rooms furnished with a bed, a desk, a mirror and a closet. The kitchen and showers were shared amongst everyone on the floor (around 20 people). A Washing machine and dryer was avaiable on every alternate floor.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was on 92nd street and took about 15 minutes to the office by subway (4,5,6 line) during non-rush-hour times and 20-25 minutes otherwise. Some of the interns chose to walk to work everyday which took about 35 minutes.

<h4>THE OFFICE</h4>

<div id="bb-the-office">
  <p>
    Bloomberg HQ is located at the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 59th street (near the 59th street subway station). The building is 55 storeys and Bloomberg LP occupies the bottom 29 floors. I worked on the 26th floor on the Instant Bloomberg team. The office itself has an open office floor plan. All meeting rooms have glass walls in accordance with the company's policy of transparency. There is at least one large aquarium on every floor. There's also a great view of Central Park from the 29th floor.

    <br />
    Breakfast is provided for free for all employees. There is an assortment of breads, bagels, spreads, cereals, and more. If you arrive early enough, you may also get yogurt and fresh fruit, but these go out quickly. Dinner is provided between 8PM and 9PM, and is always a healthy recipe. The cafeteria is also stacked with all sorts of snacks. Hot soup is provided everyday at 11AM.

  <p>
    There are plenty of restaurants nearby serving a variety of cuisines. Restaurants were affordable, with the majority of the places I went to costing < $10 for lunch. There are also several places to shop nearby including Bloombingdale's,  H&M, Gap, Banana Republic and Zara located within 100 meters of the building.

<h4>SALARY</h4>

<div id="bb-salary">
  <p>
    As mentioned before, Bloomberg provides free housing for interns and provides airfare and taxi service to and from LaGuardia. The salary is very competitive. Bloomberg software interns are paid hourly, and working 40 hours a week, at the time of writing, interns here make more than interns at Amazon or Google.
  </p>

<br />
<h4>WORK-LIFE BALANCE</h4>

<div id="bb-work-life-balance">
  <p>
    I made this a separate topic because I was surprised at the work-life balance situation at this company. Interns were encouraged NOT to work more than 40 hours a week. We were only allowed to do a maximum of 10 hours overtime per week, and very few of us did any overtime. I did 10 hours of overtime total over the course of 4 months. Hours are flexible and I usually got into work between 8 and 8:15 AM to beat the rush-hour subway traffic and left between 5 and 5:15 PM. During long weekends my manager told our entire team not to stay beyond 5:30 PM, and during days like Black Friday, my manager shuffled me out of the office at around 4:30 PM.

<br />
<h4>NEW YORK</h4>

<div id="bb-new-york">
  <p>
    The city is also huge draw for Bloomberg. It's one of the few big tech companies to have a major office in New York City. The NYC subway, though old and infested with rats, is enough to take you pretty much anywhere you need to go within the 5 boroughs. While working at Bloomberg, employees can  access almost all the museums located in the city for free. To me, this was one of the best perks any company could offer, since I went to so many places that I normally wouldn't even know existed.

<h4>SUMMARY</h4>

<div id="bb-summary">
  <p>
    Working at Bloomberg was a great experience. The work environment was not stressful. Coworkers were always helpful. The company also has teams working on different topics related to computer science, so there are a lot of opportunities to learn. The location, compensation, and perks were excellent. One of the best internships I've done.
